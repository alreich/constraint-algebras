# constraint-algebras
Algebras for qualitative reasoning about time, space, etc.

NOTE: This code was written in the early 1990s and has only been partially tested since then using Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL).  The portions tested appeared to work OK.  However, it does not appear to work using Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL).

More to come (perhaps) so ...watch this space...
